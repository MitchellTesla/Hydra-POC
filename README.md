## :sunrise_over_mountains: Introduction

Hydra is the layer-two scalability solution for Cardano, which aims to increase
the speed of transactions (low latency, high throughput) and minimize
transaction cost.

This repository contains the proof-of-concept implementation for the Hydra
[Head protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299.pdf).  It is a developer
preview that we've put together, marching towards a production ready solution.
It outlines the basic architecture of a `hydra-node`, which runs a simplified
(coordinated) Hydra Head protocol, connects to other hydra-nodes, interfaces
the Cardano blockchain and provides an API to clients such as the included
terminal user interface `hydra-tui`.

> This is still prototypical and exploratory work shared here for your
interest.
>
> It is NOT ready for production (yet).

## :rocket: Getting started

The quickest way to get a `hydra-node` running is to use our [docker
images](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/packages?repo_name=hydra-poc).

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/input-output-hk/hydra-node:latest
docker run --rm ghcr.io/input-output-hk/hydra-node --help
```

More information (including a demo) available on [user manual ðŸ“–](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/getting-started)!

## :rainbow: Features

Proof of concept:
- [x] Coordinated Hydra Head protocol
- [x] Single Head per hydra-node
- [x] Stubbed chain using external process
- [x] Network statically configured, direct TCP connections
- [x] WebSocket, message-based API Server
- [x] Terminal user interface client
- [x] Cardano-node integration via Direct connection
- [x] Running on testnet

Later:
- [ ] Persisted Head state
- [ ] Audited and mainnet ready
- [ ] Multiple Heads per hydra-node, managed via API
- [ ] Support for external wallets (e.g. hardware wallets)
- [ ] Optimistic Head closure and incremental de-/commit protocol extension
- [ ] Relay-capable, mesh network
